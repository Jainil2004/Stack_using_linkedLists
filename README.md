# Stack_using_linkedLists
This repo houses the implementation of stack data structure using singly linked lists. It also has a custom specifically UI for manipulation of the stack.
currently the program is capable of only handling a single instance of the struct stack. I am working on it so that multiple instances could also be managed.
